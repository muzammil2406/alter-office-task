This project is a scalable analytics backend that lets websites and apps register to receive an API key, send user interaction events (clicks, page views, device details, referrer data), and retrieve analytics insights such as event summaries, unique users, and device breakdowns. It includes API key management, event collection, analytics reporting, Redis caching, rate limiting, PostgreSQL storage, Swagger documentation, Docker setup, and a production-ready architecture.
